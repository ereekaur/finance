---------- Insurance calculations ----------


 In this portfolio I shall calculate some common cases which in my opinon are interesting   
 and may occur in insurance companies.

#1 In the first example data is read from excel sheet and claims are assumed to be Poisson distributed.
The data is being simulated and confidence intervals with corresponding quantiles are printed.


#2 In the second example I consider certain bonus classes and how steep difference there should be 
between classes taking account the variance in order to maximize revenue


#3 TODO: MOLP
