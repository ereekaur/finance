 In this portfolio I calculate some common cases which in my opinon are interesting   
 and occur in insurance companies.                                                      

#1 In the first example data is being read from excel sheet and the claim cost are assumed to be Poisson distributed.
The data is being simulated and confidence intervals with corresponding quantiles are printed.

#2 In the second example I consider certain bonus classes and how steep difference there should be 
between classes taking account the variance in order to maximize revenue.

#3 Third example considers whether certain stock data deviates from Brownian motion or not


TODO:  

1) Add SL/XL -insurance analyses example
2) Try to simulate data in #1 using Panjer algorithm'
3) What happens if the normal distribution in the example #1 is replaced with Cauchy distribution
as it in some sense describes better the worst case scenario
