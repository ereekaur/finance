 In this portfolio I have collected and calculated some common cases whichcould occur or are
 otherwise interesting in finance world.                                                      

 
#1 In the first example I have insurance data, namely dates and claims costs for each day. 
Let us assume we can expect 100 claims to occur and we want to calculate, based on this data
what are the claim costs. First thought might be that we take 100 random costs from that 
data over and over again,say one million times which yields

#2 In the second example I consider certain (imaginary) bonus classes in insurance companies and I will find out
how steep difference there should be between classes taking account the variance in order to maximize revenue.

#3 The third example considers how much certain stock data deviates from Brownian motion or not.
Here, I shall take a look at crypto-currencies and for the question "how much" is 
being answered using several statistical tests.


TODO:  

1) Add SL/XL -insurance analyses example
2) Try to simulate data in #1 using Panjer algorithm
3) What happens if the Poisson distribution in the example #1 is being replaced with Cauchy distribution
as it in some sense describes better the worst case scenario
