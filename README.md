 In this portfolio I examine some common cases which in my opinion are interesting,   
 and occur in finance calculations.                                                      


#1 In the first example insurance data is being read from excel sheet and the claim costs are assumed 
to be Poisson distributed. The data is being simulated and confidence intervals with corresponding 
quantiles are printed.

#2 In the second example I consider certain bonus classes in insurance companies and how steep difference 
there should be between classes taking account the variance in order to maximize revenue.

#3 The third example considers how much certain stock data deviates from Brownian motion or not.
Here, I shall take a look at crypto-currencies and for the question "how much" is 
being answered using several statistical tests.


TODO:  

1) Add SL/XL -insurance analyses example
2) Try to simulate data in #1 using Panjer algorithm
3) What happens if the Poisson distribution in the example #1 is being replaced with Cauchy distribution
as it in some sense describes better the worst case scenario
